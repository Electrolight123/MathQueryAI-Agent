A smart AI-powered assistant built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google Gemma 2**, capable of solving complex text-based mathematical problems and searching Wikipedia for relevant information. This agent uses multiple tools — a calculator, logical reasoning chain, and a knowledge retriever — all orchestrated through a `zero-shot-react-description` LangChain agent.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Converts real-world word problems into structured math problems and solves them step-by-step.
- 🌐 Wikipedia-powered research for context-aware knowledge support.
- 🤖 Agent-based architecture with reasoning and math tools.
- 🔐 Secure integration with Groq API for LLM access.
- ⚡ Interactive UI with Streamlit for real-time Q&A.

## 📁 Folder & File Structure

```bash
.
├── app.py                 # 🚀 Main entry point for Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt       # 📦 Python dependencies

```

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MathQueryAI-Agent.git
cd MathQueryAI-Agent
```
### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🔑 Configuration

You must enter your **Groq API Key** in the sidebar when prompted to access the Gemma 2 LLM.

> 🔐 **Groq API Key** is required for the LLM to function. The app won’t proceed without it.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
The app initializes an agent with three powerful tools:

### 📚 Wikipedia Tool
- Uses WikipediaAPIWrapper to fetch topic summaries.

### ➕ Calculator Tool
- Uses LLMMathChain to solve numeric problems.

### 💡 Reasoning Tool
- Custom PromptTemplate and LLMChain to solve logic-based queries.

Once a user inputs a question, the agent selects the most appropriate tool (or combination) to generate a clear, step-by-step answer using Gemma 2 LLM hosted by Groq.

## ✍️ Usage Example

```css
I have 5 bananas and 7 grapes. I eat 2 bananas and give away 3 grapes. 
Then I buy a dozen apples and 2 packs of blueberries. Each pack of blueberries contains 25 berries. 
How many total pieces of fruit do I have at the end?
```

✅ The assistant parses the logic, performs calculations, and returns:

> 🧮 Final Count: 67 fruits
> 📝 Step-by-step explanation (pointwise)
